        <p>Hi, I'm Chris Pecoraro, a bass player with over 10 years of experience playing in a variety of musical settings. My background spans blues bands, jazz combos, show bands, and orchestras, and I earned my music minor from the University of Minnesota.</p>
        
        <p>While my playing style is rooted in retro soul, I'm versatile and can play a range of genres, including pop, blues, rock, jazz, and funk. My influences include Jaco Pastorius, Pino Palladino, and Oteil Burbridge, all of whom have shaped my unique approach to the bass.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I play with the Sean McKee Band, winners of the International Blues Challenge. I'm passionate about collaborating with other musicians, both in person and remotely, and I always look for opportunities to contribute to new projects.</p>
        
        <p>If you'd like to work together, whether it's for a recording session, live performance, or another musical project, I'd love to hear from you. Let's make some great music.</p>
        <p>I'm available for studio sessions, live performances, and bass lessons. If you're interested in working with me, please <router-link to="/contact">contact me</router-link>.</p>
